# RFM Analysis
## Introduction
RFM analysis is very popular marketing technique which used to analyse customer's behaviour, it was firstly introduced 1995 by Bult and Wansbeek and it was proven that this kind of analysis is very effective on sales/marketing databases.
RFM stands for: 


**R(Recency)**: refers to the interval between the time and the last consuming behaviour happens.

**F(Frequency)**:is the total number of transactions that a customer has made in a specific period.

**M(Monetary)**: is the cumulative total of money spent by a customer.

Those three variables are important variables which help companies to keep track of their customer's profiles and build a relationship which increases sales and profitability. RFM analysis is very useful when it comes to dividing customers into different groups for future enhanced services and identification of loyal customers.
Integrating data mining techniques and RFM analysis provides very useful information about the current and new customers. For instance, association rules based on RFM model could analyse the association and the relation between the products that are bought together frequently to better understand customers buying behaviours and suggest recommendation to satisfy customer's needs. Clustering based on RFM provides knowledge about the customer's marketing segments and give a better opportunity for successful marketing campaigns.
Decision trees which are built on customer's demographic information and RFM clusters are very crucial to predict the new customer's behaviours like the probability of purchases and how often the customer will purchase and what is the value of the purchases.

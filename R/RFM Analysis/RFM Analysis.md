# RFM Analysis
## Introduction
RFM analysis is very popular marketing technique which used to analyse customer's behaviour, it was firstly introduced 1995 by Bult and Wansbeek and it was proven that this kind of analysis is very effective on sales/marketing databases.
RFM stands for: 


**R(Recency)**: refers to the interval between the time and the last consuming behaviour happens.

**F(Frequency)**:is the total number of transactions that a customer has made in a specific period.

**M(Monetary)**: is the cumulative total of money spent by a customer.

Those three variables are important variables which help companies to keep track of their customer's profiles and build a relationship which increases sales and profitability. RFM analysis is very useful when it comes to dividing customers into different groups for future enhanced services and identification of loyal customers.

Integrating data mining techniques and RFM analysis provides very useful information about the current and new customers. For instance, association rules based on RFM model could analyse the association and the relation between the products that are bought together frequently to better understand customers buying behaviours and suggest recommendation to satisfy customer's needs. Clustering based on RFM provides knowledge about the customer's marketing segments and give a better opportunity for successful marketing campaigns.
Decision trees which are built on customer's demographic information and RFM clusters are very crucial to predict the new customer's behaviours like the probability of purchases and how often the customer will purchase and what is the value of the purchases.

Finally, the following sections are divided as the following, section 1 introduces the data set and some explorations techniques used to understand the data, section 2 is about calculating RFM scores and segments and prepare the dataset for data mining algorithms, section 3 presents customer segmentation based on RFM using DBscan, section 4  shows how to predict new customers type based on RFM values using decision trees and random forest and it will depend on ad boost to determine the   importance of the customer's demographic variables which are used to build the prediction, section 5 provides the basis of basket analysis for a specific customer segments which allow understanding the behaviors of existing customers, and finally conclusion to summarize the result and the findings.
